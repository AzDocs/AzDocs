# Clearing unintended whitelists
*NOTE: This is not the final version of Clearing unintended whitelists. Our roadmap contains epics to straighten this out.*

To keep security & compliancy in place, we need to make sure that we don't add IP's to our whitelists temporarily, and then forgetting about them. At the point of writing we don't have anything in the AzDocs yet, but we will look into this in the future. So for now, make sure you do check this from time to time.
