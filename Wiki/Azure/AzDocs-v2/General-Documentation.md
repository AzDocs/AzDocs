# Intoduction

In this folder you will find the general documentation for AzDocs v2.

# Bicep

The AzDocs v2 solely consists out of Bicep modules. The goal is to have a declerative & desired-state set of modules which can be used to quickly spin up your desired platform.

# Pipelines

The idea is that one or more of the modules from this library will form your pipeline (either in Azure DevOps YAML Pipelines or a bicep file) which actually spins up the infra for your software. This is similar to how it used to work in AzDocs v1. However the documentation is not finished yet for v2 for this.

Please take inspiration from the AzDocs v1, which you can find here: [How to use the scripts](/Azure/AzDocs-v1/General-Documentation/How-to-use-the-scripts).

# Naming convention

Please refer to the [Naming convention](/Azure/AzDocs-v2/General-Documentation/Naming-convention).

# Guidelines for creating new modules
