# Resource Provider

[Resource Providers](/Azure/AzDocs-v1/Scripts/Resource-Provider/Register-Provider) are used to retrieve information about resource providers and types. To be able to use these providers, you will have to enable them for your subscription, e.g. using 'Microsoft.Insights'. That's what this script does for you. Just provide the name of the resource provider and you're all set!

To find a list of resource providers you can choose from, see [Resource Providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers#match-resource-provider-to-service) for more information.
